A minimal iOS AR app to display 360 / video in sphere space.

- Xcode 13.2.1
- Target: iOS / iPadOS 14.0+
- SwiftUI, ARKit, RealityKit

This app uses RealityKit's VideoMaterial and AVFoundation's AVQueuePlayer to play video / audio as a texture for a sphere model.

This is a minimal implementation, so please improve the quality or modify it to your app.

- Sync-loading of Assets => Async-loading
- Video texture inversion (currently incorrect)
- Video playback control such as start and pause
- Replacing the video file with your favorite one
- Changing the sphere space size (currently 1.5 meters radius)

The 360 video is provided by mettle. Thank you for sharing nice content.
The video has a watermark. You can purchase the video without a watermark.
